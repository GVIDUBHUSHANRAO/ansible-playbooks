1. I have a playbook with host group dev. Now I need to override without opening the file in command line
Ans.
---
- hosts: "{{ variable_host | default('web') }}"
  tasks:
  - name: create user
    user: name=testvar state=present
  - name: install httpd
    yum: name=httpd state=installed
    tags: app
  - name: start service
    service: name=httpd state=started
    tags: app


# ansible-playbook playbook1.yaml --extra-vars "variable_host=database"

2. How to call another inventory file dynamically to run my playbook( in /root/hosts)
Ans. If the location given to -i in Ansible is a directory (or as so configured in ansible.cfg ), Ansible can use multiple inventory sources at the same time.

# vi /etc/ansible/hosts
[web]
65.0.102.46

[database]
3.110.87.194

[amazon]
65.0.102.46
3.110.87.194
:wq!
# vi /root/hosts
[web]
65.0.102.46
:wq!
# vi playbook1.yaml
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: create user
    user: name=test state=present
:wq!
# ansible-playbook playbook1.yaml -i /root/hosts

-after that check server with public ip 65.0.102.46 by typing command
# id test
uid=1007(test) gid=1007(test) groups=1007(test)

-As you can see we have given all(- hosts: all), if it considered /etc/ansible/hosts, the user test should be present in other server(3.110.87.194)


3. Instead of running my tasks sequentially, how can I run them in parallel (hintstrategies)
Ans.

************if we want to run tasks in the below order,
all tasks - 1st server
all tasks - 2nd server
all tasks - 3rd server

---
- hosts: amazon
  serial: 1
  tasks:
  - name: create user
    user: name=test11 state=present
  - name: install httpd
    yum: name=httpd state=installed
    tags: app
  - name: start service
    service: name=httpd state=started
    tags: app

4. How to ignore the warning popup message when running the ansible command
Ans. Goto ansible.cfg file and add "interpreter_python=auto_silent" inside defaults like this,
     
#vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
[defaults]
interpreter_python=auto_silent
